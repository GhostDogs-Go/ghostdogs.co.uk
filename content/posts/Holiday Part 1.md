December is always going to be hard for Tam and me. The hole that was left in our lives when Bev died gets bigger again once December comes around. For Tam the sight of Christmas decorations and adverts can become too much and I have to try to isolate him from it. 

This year seems things seem to have become too much for him earlier than usual.
