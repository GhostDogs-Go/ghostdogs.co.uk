It's Monday night and Tam has been home for about 12 hours. This is the first photo taken of him.

  <em>A happy boy <a href="#" target="_blank"></a></em>

To say he is a happy boy would be an understatement. He has been searching the flat, sorting things out and getting his bags unpacked and put away. 

The last 2 weeks have really gotten away from me. I have felt constantly busy with conversations, meetings, DIY, and just getting organised. 

Right now he feels like the Tam I knew from before Bev died. He is so full of smiles, glad to be home and just a happy happy boy.
