I was going to write about things that went well and things that were tough in 2021. It was tough thinking about the year so I decided to write about one thing. Tam had a photo published in Amatuer Photography magazine. 

It was a shock when we got an email saying that they wanted to publish it. So highlight of the year was Tam taking a copy of the magazine to bed and falling asleep looking at his name and photo in a magazine.

Short and sweet post but thankful for the joy this brought my boy.
