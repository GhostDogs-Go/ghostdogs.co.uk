Looking after Tam and myself can be tough. Over the past few days it has been really tough. Yesterday Tam was sick. Nothing he had eaten that I can blame but he kept purging for hours and it became too much. I pleaded with him to go to bed and rest as I was not coping.

Even with Tam in his bedroom and resting I was still not with it. Everything I tried to do was too much. I felt like I was going to be smashed in the face at any moment. My head was constantly wanting to flinch. I could not calm down.

I went to check on Tam and he asked for a cuddle. So we cuddled and I talked and Tam listened. He eventually turned over and went to sleep, so did I.

We both woke at 10pm. I felt better but Tam is still stressed out. So at 2am we went for a walk around the block and sat on a wall listening to the birds singing.

It's now 4am and we are both more settled and about to watch Flushed Away.

Point of the story is that isolation is tough. Bad days will happen and all that can be done is to stay safe and be good to yourself and the others around you.
